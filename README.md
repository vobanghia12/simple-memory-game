## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
To be able complete this projects, I used Google to search up new things that I have not known such as AudioContext API. Detaied websites that I used are Stack Overflow, W3Schools, and Developer Mozilla. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
One of most challenging thing that I encountered is to struggle with my mindset because the thought of thinking not to be chosen in the next round popped up in my head nonstop. That thought told me that if I was not chosen, this attemp will be a waste. However, thinking about my family and my circumtance, these pushed my up in working in this project during 4 hour. As my family are immigrant and we have just come to USA in 3 years, they cannot take care all of my expenses so that I could be comfortable to focus on my education. Therefore, thinking about that, it pushed me up to complete this project even though it is not as my expectation because I cannot complete the final feature. However, I'm glad because I overcome myself and defeat negative thought to complete a cool application. 

Another challenge is to read others' code. I alsway have the hard time to be able to understand someone code, especially they use new term. By overcoming this problem, I take slower step as reading and searching each line of code because I cannot absorb all of code into my head and understand one time. That way will make me more stressful. By apply this method, I can be able to make my head more relax and work toward this project in consecutive hours

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I have always had hard time to understand the API, especially its function. I tried to find function of AudiocContext to dive deeper to gain more understanding, but I cannot. Therefore, how I can access to those functions to get more understanding so that I fully have control on my code?

Also, at my school, I learned a lot about data structure and algorithm, is that important for web development? 

About adding ticking clock feature, when I glance over it, my head feel like very complicated and I only have like 2 hour left before deadline. How can I break a complicated feature to small part and feel possible to implement it?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Firstly, I need to refactor my code, add more comments and change name varible, so that readers can easily understand of my code as in the future I need to work in a team. my code has a lot of very long function, so I wish I could have more time break it down to smaller function. Also, I really want to challenge myself to complete and learn how to add ticking clock to the project, so that my project could be more realistic. As Mark Zukerberg used to said he always do things that he have never done before, that is why ticking clock feature motivated me to complete it. I would love to dive deeper in AudioContext API to explore more feature to improve sound for this project like could create a tune of famous song when we press down the button. Even though I submited the project, I will continue to work toward this project to create awesome product and improve my web development skill
